# dashboard
user experience 
## 1) Sign up page:
  --fields can't be empty on submit
  
  --you can't sign up with existing account name;
  
  --confirm password must match password
 
## 2) Sign in page:
   --fields can't be empty on submit
   
   --you have to register an account to be able to login
   
   --password must match the one you provided early (obviously :D)
   
## 3) Dashboard page:
  --You can't access this page with out sign in first (if you try to type the address in the address bar you get an error message and be redirected to the sign in page)
  
  --you can enter comments (the main idea for this simple dashboard)
  
  --comments will be saved in the browser local storage and thus will be available when refresh and when sign out and sign back in with the same credentials
  
  --every account can have its unique comments
